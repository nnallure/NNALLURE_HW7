BAIS3300 - Web form

# Business Analytics Student Survey

## Description of the Project
This project is a web-based survey designed to gather insights from students enrolled in the Business Analytics program. It aims to collect data on students' backgrounds, their impressions of the BAIS program, and their academic progress.

## Best Practices for Forms
In designing the web form for this survey, several best practices were meticulously followed to ensure a user-friendly, efficient, and effective data collection process.

### Clarity and Simplicity
Firstly, each question is worded clearly and concisely to avoid confusion, making it straightforward for respondents to understand what information is being requested. This is crucial for accurate data collection and enhances the overall user experience.

### Logical Flow and Grouping
The form is structured logically, with related questions grouped together under relevant headings. This organizational strategy not only makes the form appear less daunting but also guides the respondent through the survey in an intuitive manner. Grouping related questions together helps maintain the respondent's focus and facilitates a smoother transition from one topic to another.

### Required Fields and Validation
To ensure the completeness and integrity of the data collected, required fields are marked clearly, and form validation is implemented. This approach prevents the form from being submitted with incomplete or incorrectly formatted data. For instance, the email address field validates the input format, and the "Year at Iowa" question does not allow progression without a selection, ensuring that essential data points are not missed.

## Accessibility
Accessibility was a key consideration in the development of this web form, ensuring that all potential respondents, regardless of ability, can participate in the survey.

### Semantic HTML and ARIA Labels
The form makes extensive use of semantic HTML5 elements and ARIA labels to enhance accessibility. This includes proper use of `<label>` elements associated with each input field and the incorporation of ARIA roles where appropriate. These practices ensure that screen readers and other assistive technologies can accurately interpret and interact with the form.

### Contrast and Readability
Attention was also given to visual design to ensure high contrast and readability. Text size, color contrasts, and spacing were carefully selected to comply with WCAG 2.1 guidelines, making the form more accessible to users with visual impairments.

By adhering to these best practices and accessibility guidelines, the survey aims to provide an inclusive, user-friendly experience that encourages participation and yields high-quality data from a diverse student body.
